## Program Overview

The **Blockchain na Escola (BnE)** Destino Devconnect initiative is a pioneering educational program focused on critical and practical training of public school students about decentralized technologies, new digital economies, and transformations in the world of work.

Launched in 2022, we have conducted free blockchain training for Brazilian schools, operating in Salvador, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. We also created the Blcktopia project focused on social currencies and environmental regeneration in peripheral communities.

In 2025, we bring focus to the blockchain market as a whole, identifying the sector as one of the major areas with future opportunities that can be truly useful to participating students. The objective is to introduce basic concepts about finance, technology, and new markets with an optimized methodology for this journey.

## Mission Statement

This program addresses a simple and urgent diagnosis: the technological transformations of the new internet (Web3) are creating new professions, new business models, and new income possibilities. But this knowledge is still inaccessible to most young people in public schools.

Brazil's new National High School Policy provides for formative itinerary offerings, aiming for certification, preparation for the work world, and deepening knowledge about emerging technologies. We aim to address the disparity of access to such knowledge by young people from public schools or low-income backgrounds.

## Program Structure

### Basic Program Data

| **Duration** | **Target Audience** | **Total Students** | **Final Delivery** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 week Bootcamp + University Visit | High School Students | ~50 students (2 schools) | Web3 solution proposals with integration |

### Pedagogical Journey

Our pedagogical journey was designed to generate engagement through an experience that allows students to visualize how blockchain and Web3 can affect their reality with a sense of belonging.

The opportunity to experience environments typically inaccessible, such as technology spaces and companies in the city, fosters interest in participating in practical activities that bring real contact with the professional technology world.

For each completed activity at the end of each day, students redeem badges that will be used in program gamification and certificate reception. To qualify, each student needs to have earned at least 3 of the 4 journey badges.

We use $NOS tokens as educational currency, allowing students to receive and send in exchange for experiences, generating engagement for participation, filling out surveys about interests, satisfaction, task completion, incentivized by tokenization.

## Social Impact: Opening University Doors

### The Challenge
Many students from public schools in peripheral communities have never visited a university and are unaware of higher education opportunities available to them. This program represents a profound social impact by connecting students from underserved areas with academic and technological environments that can transform their life trajectories.

### Our Solution
Using Destino Devconnect funding exclusively for transportation, meals, and materials to take students out of classrooms and into:
- **Public Universities**: Guided tours showing higher education possibilities
- **Tech Hubs**: Real-world Web3 professional environments
- **Career Meetups**: Connections with leading Brazilian Web3 communities

## Certification

Each approved student will receive a digital certificate and all documentation will be made available online, allowing students to have a permanent record of their portfolio and program participation.

Schools and mentors also receive certifications, strengthening institutional bonds.


## Sustainability and Future Plans

- Establish medium-term partnership with Minas Gerais State Education Department for 2026
- Create replicable methodology for other Brazilian regions
- Open institutional channels for continued Web3 education integration
- Build sustainable pathways connecting public education with Web3 opportunities
