Last weekend, Blockchain na Escola participated in EthSamba in Rio de Janeiro. The event, created by people who truly believe in the power of community, set a precedent for blockchain ecosystem development in Brazil, standing out during a week of major events in the capital city.

Held across two venues, while bootcamps and conferences took place at the elegant Windsor Hotel Conference Center, the hackathon - a challenge to create solutions for the blockchain ecosystem - happened at a HackerHouse in Santa Teresa, which ended with lots of code on computers and bare feet on the grass.

## Conference Opening (04/01)
During the conference opening on April 1st, our team presented the initiative as an experience to strengthen Brazil's Web3 creation, development and innovation ecosystem through inclusion and stimulation of new experiences in different locations, cities and communities.

The perspective of creating leadership for the Brazilian ecosystem remained aligned with the desire to strengthen regional growth across Latin America.

## Three Days of Activities
The event featured three days of bootcamps, workshops, conferences and hackathons.

### Bootcamps
Participants were introduced to various developing technologies, such as the "account abstraction" technology powered by team Prosperity to create an inheritance solution where assets are automatically distributed to heirs' wallets upon the beneficiary's death.

### Workshops
Workshops covered diverse topics:
- Using AI to prototype Web3 products with Fabricio Miranda
- Solutions presented by Solange Gueiros
- Smart contract development
- Digital security
- New work tools
- And various other technologies presented to the community

### Conferences
The next day's conferences were equally impressive, addressing topics in English, Spanish, Portuguese and our favorite - "PortuÃ±ol". Our team was involved in very interesting discussions in the morning.

#### Public Goods Panel
In the panel dedicated to Public Goods and developers' role in building this paradigm, speaker Romina Sejas (Crypto_Chica) impressed with her empathy and content, inviting the community to reinvent solutions and innovations.

> "The development of goods with shared ownership and benefits should favor the common good, allowing knowledge dissemination and collective, community development while promoting social inclusion."  
> **- Crypto_Chica | Romina Sejas**

The conference space proved extremely valuable, closely tied to the event's overall goal of consolidating a community proposing collective construction, interconnected infrastructure development, and impactful practices.

According to Crypto_Chica, this requires:
- Professional structuring around Public Goods initiatives
- Expanding spaces for their dissemination across knowledge areas
- Incentives for professional growth of practitioners

Key Public Goods spaces in Web3 were presented, including Gitcoin, CLR Fund, DAO Drops, and #RPGF2, along with encouragement to foster this ecosystem through toolbuilding, parameters, criteria and more.

It's crucial to consolidate criteria for truly regenerative initiatives - beyond discourse, we need to build values and understand Web3's true power lies in decentralization while valuing its common good foundations.

#### Celo's Presentation
Next, in an incredible conference, Camila Rioja (Mila Rioja), Celo's Latin America lead, spoke about tokenizing public goods in Web3, showing how this technology can develop important professional skills.

Presenting CELO as a protocol focused on shared prosperity, she announced the Web3 Hackathon: Tokenization of Federal Assets, developed in partnership with:
- Brazil's Ministry of Economy
- SERPRO (world's largest public tech company)
- FLACSO (prestigious Latin American Social Sciences Faculty)
- Other partners

> "Public goods (Article 20 of Brazil's Constitution, regulated by Law 9636/1998) belong to the Union and serve public interest - including lands, lakes, rivers, islands, beaches, mineral resources, and indigenous territories. Tokenizing these R$2 trillion assets could transform their use, bringing transparency, security, efficiency, economic value and collective well-being - taking Real World Assets (RWAs) to another level."  
> **- Mila Rioja | Celo**

The hackathon tracks sought to build institutional legacy around use cases and management of tokenized assets.

> "Reimagining paths to public good requires conscious construction, knowledge flexibility, and openness to new possibilities. How do we create partnerships? What are these initiatives' purposes? How do we aggregate multilateralism? How to build legacy? How to create open-source strategies? How to hack together? Get to know Brazil through the eyes of hackathon participants."  
> **- Mila Rioja**

## Hackathon Experience
We can't forget the overwhelming experience at the hackathon with AgroforestDAO and Ekonavi teams, led by Miguel, creating a gamified experience of agroforestry initiatives and environmental regeneration in the metaverse. The solution synchronized ecological experiences in the physical world with in-game incentives - for example, players would receive game items for learning ecological techniques or participating in environmental activities.

An entire agroforestry ecosystem was built with technical rigor, as this ancestral yet technological practice demands - a sustainable, ecologically integrated cultivation method for biodiversity, food, products and fibers, representing a prime example of real regenerative practice.

Though we didn't win, the experience was incredible, building mutual trust relationships to take new steps in creating truly regenerative educational solutions.

Among Celo's awarded projects, highlights include Vozes Seguras - an onchain platform for women to anonymously share experiences while accessing legal guidance and psychological support.

## The Venue
The event took place in a mansion in Santa Teresa that, while reminiscent of colonial past, served as counterpoint for building regeneration and social impact proposals. All enhanced by unparalleled service from staff, volunteers and all attendees. Special shoutout to the kitchen team who maintained abundance throughout the event.

## Final Outcomes
The event:
- Distributed ~$10,000 to innovation solutions
- Integrated the crypto community
- Materialized virtual connections in person
- Celebrated Brazil's current and potential influence in Web3

Blockchain na Escola attended and plans to return many times - we want to drink from this fountain to nurture our initiatives and development!

Thanks for everything - let there be more!
