# Blockchain na Escola at the Ethereum Cyberpunk Congress

## November 10, 2024 - Lido Connect, Bangkok, Thailand

The cyberpunk movement is typically associated with cultural references that since the 1980s have been part of the fight for civil rights in the computing and internet era. It's fair to say that blockchain technology emerged closely tied to the pursuit of security, privacy and individual autonomy made possible through cryptography.

## Introduction

Held at Lido Connect on a busy Bangkok avenue, Web3 Privacy organized the Ethereum Cyberpunk Congress - an artistic, cultural and sensory immersion featuring:
- Debate stages
- Dark rooms with musical installations
- Traditional Thai cuisine

The cyber-futurist aesthetic combined with expert discussions on cybersecurity and blockchain development provided important foundations about Web3's future and the internet's potential uses.

## Cyberpunk Culture and Web3

"Cypherpunk" blends "cipher" (to encode) and "punk" (resistance/counterculture) to describe a movement advocating cryptographic tools for individual privacy and security against intrusive governments and corporations.

### Key Cultural References:

**Literature:**
- *Cyberpunk Manifesto*, Erik Hughes 1993
- *Make Ethereum Cyberpunk Again*, Vitalik Buterin 2023

**Art/Film:**
- *Blade Runner* (1982), Ridley Scott
- *Neuromancer* (1984), William Gibson
- *Akira* (1988), Katsuhiro Otomo
- *Cyberpunk 2077* (2020), CD Projekt Red

As internet and globalization advanced, most social interactions and productive activities became large-scale collaborations happening on centralized corporate servers controlling our data and information access. This critique fueled advanced cryptography and blockchain development, birthing today's on-chain protocols and communities.

## Web3 Fundamentals

A decentralized, secure and trustworthy internet - dubbed Web3 - requires these foundational conditions:

1. **Decentralization**: Data/apps operating without central control
2. **Censorship Resistance**: Autonomous knowledge production
3. **Cooperation**: Ecosystems for shared research/security/community-building
4. **Resilience**: Transparent, auditable systems creating safer networks

## The Event

Organized by Web3 Privacy Now, the Cyberpunk Congress preceded DEVCON 2024 by reconnecting Ethereum's community to its origins in hacker activism and the fight for a free, fair internet.

Talks included Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussing the network's future, plus other speakers exploring cryptography's role in individual/collective autonomy.

## Blockchain na Escola: Education and Digital Citizenship

Since 2022, Blockchain na Escola (BnE) has created educational programs bringing ReFi/DeFi concepts to Brazilian public schools, initially targeting teacher/student exposure to Web3 topics.

### Our Reach:
- 19 workshops in Salvador, Bahia alone
- 400+ students and 20 teachers reached in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais (first half 2023)
- Created the NO$ socio-educational token for student certification and on-chain program tracking
- Blcktopia side-project tokenizing real solutions in Belo Horizonte's peripheral communities

> "Woforo dua pa a" - "When you climb the good tree"  
> Symbol of support, cooperation and encouragement

Beyond technical education, we foster discussions about:
- The internet's potential for communication networks
- Real-world solution development
- Blockchain/Web3 career opportunities

## Basic Education and Disruptive Technologies

Recent research on Information/Communication Technologies in Brazilian schools (*TIC Educação 2023*) shows:

✅ Public schools are crucial for youth exposure to new learning technologies  
⚠️ Despite improved internet/computer access, targeted public policies are needed for quality implementation  

Understanding:
- How the internet operates
- Data privacy risks
- Online financial/non-financial products

...is directly tied to achieving digital citizenship.

> "Promoting digital education is key for disseminating critical digital skills among students and school communities, fostering responsible, secure technology use."

## HUM4NT3CH: Humanized Tech Development

We launched the **HUM4NT3CH** initiative to humanize Web3/blockchain education. In 2024, we built the **BnE.LAB** teaching lab (public debut coming soon) to stimulate:
- Research
- Investigation
- Solution-building in blockchain for Brazilian education

## Closing Thoughts

We strongly believe education remains fundamental for:
- Onboarding new blockchain users
- Strengthening innovation/development
- Advancing protocols' core objectives

Beyond accessible content and learning tools, we remain committed to materials supporting a safer, more cooperative online environment.
