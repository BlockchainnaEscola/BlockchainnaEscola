Article: https://substack.com/inbox/post/148023999?r=4bd0o2&showWelcomeOnShare=true&triedRedirect=true

### August 10, 2024  

On **August 10**, we developed an unprecedented event in Belo Horizonte, like a special chapter of **Blcktopia** – a project created to bring education about blockchain and Web3 to peripheral and vulnerable communities: **BH Crypto Day**.  

While in Brazil crypto events only take place in privileged spaces, with expensive tickets, organized by and for white people, with little diversity (normally in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), **we took all of this to the streets**.  

With partnerships with local commerce and artists, we chose the **Santa Tereza Viaduct**, birthplace of Hip-Hop, Samba, and Reggae in the city, to link urban culture with Web3 culture, using **tokenization to access benefits** and demonstrate blockchain’s potential.

## 🇧🇷 Brazil: An Opportunity to Implement Real Solutions  

The blockchain sector is already responsible for a multi-million dollar market in Brazil, with tokenizing companies, industry associations, and strong government interest.  

- The **Brazilian Treasury** has hosted hackathons for tokenization of public assets.  
- In **2022**, the **National Congress approved a crypto assets law** – a milestone in Latin America.  

Yet, the ecosystem remains distant from the general public. The **demand arises for Web3 communities to promote solutions**, strengthen local groups, and create spaces for exchange.

## 🎯 The Idea  

The event was designed to show, through **urban culture in Belo Horizonte**, what blockchain and Web3 are in a **simple and practical way**.  

- **Community**: a workshop for exchange of experiences between newcomers and blockchain users/professionals.  
- **Culture & Business**: local music shows and tokenization with a symbolic business, the bar **2Black Beer**, an Afro-enterprise central to the city’s culture.  

🌿 **Draft beer was tokenized** and distributed, bringing users and entrepreneurs closer to the potential of Web3.

## 🏗 Real World Assets (RWA)  

Real World Assets link blockchain tokens to tangible benefits.  

At BH Crypto Day, participants redeemed **event tokens (NFTs)** for real benefits at **2Black Beer**.  

- No financial cost was involved — only the token redemption for draft beer.  
- This practical demo showed blockchain as an accessible tool.

## 🧩 Critical Analysis – Challenges & Next Steps  

- Public events required fees and a dedicated team for mobilization and execution.  
- Direct user–protocol interaction is still a challenge; we used **social login wallets (Google)** to simplify onboarding.  
- Need for **Web3 community focal points** to strengthen technological implementation.  

➡️ Next edition will focus on **strengthening local Web3 talent**.
