## Event Overview
On **February 26, 2025**, the **Modular Carnival** launched at Minascentro in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais - an event created by and for Brazil's Web3 community.

In a remarkable initiative, **Blockchain na Escola** partnered with **Cola BH** to achieve what seemed impossible: mobilize **1,000 students** for a crypto event during Carnival season and school recess.  

The result surpassed expectations:
- **1,200+ registrations**  
- **Dozens of chartered buses**  
- **800+ youth attendees**  

## Crypto Events in Brazil: Participation Challenges
Events are central to Web3 companies' strategies for:
- Reaching new audiences  
- Showcasing solutions  
- Combating ecosystem misinformation  

Despite Brazil's massive crypto userbase, blockchain/Web3 topics remain confined to a bubble of:
- English-language content  
- Technical jargon  
- Tech-savvy users with quality devices  

This excludes tremendous local talent. While Brazil's crypto community increasingly hosts major events, most still feature:
- Distant locations  
- Expensive tickets  
- Low diversity/inclusivity  

## Decentralizing Beyond Rio-São Paulo
Notable that most major Brazilian crypto events (except exceptions like Salvador's **Web3day**) concentrate in **Rio-São Paulo**.  

We first noticed this during **BH Crypto Day** - Minas Gerais' first public crypto event integrating local culture/commerce, though it received little national attention.  

**Modular Carnival** broke this pattern by choosing Belo Horizonte, bringing together:
- Key Brazilian Web3 communities  
- Major blockchain protocols  
- A truly community-built experience  

## Mobilization Strategy: Accessibility = Success
When approached in December to recruit students during Carnival preparations, we faced dual challenges:
1. School vacation period  
2. Brazil's biggest holiday season  

Our solution combined **registrations with educational onboarding** about Web3/blockchain through:  

### Edu-Latam Program
- **Comic book format** for accessibility  
- **800+ on-chain certifications** issued  
- **Massive student engagement**  

### Partnership Reach
Over two months, we collaborated with:
- Federal Institute of Minas Gerais  
- Belo Horizonte public schools  
- PUC-Minas interns  
- Social projects (Rede Cidadã, CEDUC, ISBET, ISMAF, CENAF)  

## Making Tech Exciting: Event Experiences
For first-time participants, technology must demonstrate **real-world relevance**. Modular Carnival excelled with:

### Interactive Elements
- **POAP minting** for exclusive rewards  
- **Treasure hunt** with GoBTC (11 seed phrases → 12th phrase unlocked a wallet with assets)  
- **AR/VR experiences** at ColaBH's booth showing cutting-edge tech accessibility  

## Conclusion: The Path Forward
Since 2022, **Blockchain na Escola** has democratized blockchain/Web3 access across:
- Schools  
- Universities  
- Social organizations  

Events like Modular Carnival prove the power of blending:
- **Pedagogical strategies**  
- **Technology**  
- **Art/culture**  

The overwhelming participation and positive feedback confirm we're building the right **onramps for Latin America's Web3 talent pipeline**.
