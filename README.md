## Intro
Blockchain na Escola (Blockchain in School) is an innovative organization that uses education as a fundamental component of the emerging web3 ecosystem, offering free courses on blockchain and Web3, focusing on public schools to bridge the education gap in underserved communities. Our mission is to accelerate Web3 adoption in Latin America by training new talent, fostering innovation, and connecting students with real-world opportunities in the blockchain industry. Through hands-on learning and on-chain certification, we prepare the next generation to shape the future of decentralized technology.

## Executive Summary

Blockchain na Escola has certified over 30,000 students on-chain and conducted in-person workshops across four Brazilian states (SP, MG, RJ, and BA), reaching 400+ students and 20 public school teachers. Additionally, our Edu-Latam program has trained 850 students in just two months, offering both in-person and online education across Brazil.

Our curriculum covers blockchain and Web3 fundamentals, focusing on real-world use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and social impact initiatives. We are expanding our reach to universities and tech companies, bridging the gap between new talent and the Web3 job market. Our next step is to develop a Web3-based dApp to incentivize learning and enable on-chain tracking of student progress.


## Web3 and Blockchain: Tools for Empowerment and Income Generation

Global South faces growing economic inequality and limited access to emerging technologies. Public school students are often overlooked in digital education initiatives and lack exposure to blockchain and Web3, leaving them disconnected from new career opportunities.

Blockchain and Web3 offer a new path for social mobility—providing access to financial tools, new job markets, and decentralized economic models. However, most content remains inaccessible, full of technical jargon, and unavailable in Portuguese and Spanish.

To solve this, Blockchain na Escola was founded with a mission to bring free, high-quality blockchain education to public schools. From a single classroom experiment in Brazil, we’ve expanded across multiple states and certified over 30,000 students.


**A New Approach: Scaling Web3 Education**

- Building upon the success of the pilot project, Blockchain na Escola identified key pillars for scaling web3 education:

- Connecting with Students: Utilizing the deep bond between teachers and students to foster meaningful engagement.

- Real-World Applications: Integrating web3 concepts with real-world issues related to technology and finance.

- Hands-on Learning: Providing opportunities for practical application through dapp interactions and group activities.

- Continuous Improvement: Embracing feedback and adapting content to align with the evolving needs of students.

## Results  

The project plans to address this by creating engaging activities, exploring in-class use of blockchain applications (dapps), and incorporating student interest areas. Beyond workshops, they delivered presentations at corporate and educational events, reaching a wider audience. They also found that 55% of students displayed a growth mindset, suggesting a higher potential to overcome challenges:

- **30,000+ students certified online** through blockchain courses.  
- **2,000+ students participated in in-person workshops** across multiple cities.  
- **79% of students reported increased interest** in blockchain technology.  
- **56 Net Promoter Score (NPS)** from participants, indicating positive engagement.  
- **400+ students trained through on-site workshops** in public schools.  
- **55% of students demonstrated a growth mindset**, showing potential for overcoming challenges.  
- **20% NFT certification rate**, suggesting the need for increased perceived value.  
- **50% of distributed tokens claimed**, with connectivity issues being a primary barrier.  
- **Engagement in corporate and educational events**, expanding outreach beyond schools.  


## Web3: A Paradigm Shift for Social and Economic Transformation**

- Blockchain na Escola firmly believes in the transformative power of web3

- National Reach: Expand the program's impact across Brazil and potentially throughout Latin America.

- Decentralization: Beyond aesthetics, web3 represents a shift away from the current economic model's monopolistic tendencies.

- User Empowerment: Web3 empowers individuals, challenging the dominance of internet platforms that exploit their users.

- Social and Environmental Impact: Web3 holds immense potential for positive social and environmental impact, particularly in underserved communities.


## Challenges  

- **Lack of Accessible and Comprehensive Content**: Most blockchain educational resources are highly technical and not tailored for beginners, creating a steep learning curve for students.  
- **Limited Content in Local Languages**: The majority of blockchain materials are in English, making it difficult for Portuguese and Spanish-speaking students to fully grasp the concepts.  
- **Infrastructure Barriers in Public Schools**: Many schools lack reliable internet access and up-to-date computers, hindering hands-on learning with blockchain applications.  
- **Connectivity Issues Affecting Token Distribution**: Only 50% of distributed tokens were claimed, primarily due to outdated devices and internet limitations.  
- **Limited Teacher Training**: Educators often lack prior knowledge of blockchain, making it challenging to integrate Web3 concepts into their teaching methods.  
- **Skepticism and Misinformation**: Public perception of blockchain is often influenced by scams and speculative markets, creating resistance to adoption in educational environments.  
- **Scalability and Adoption in Latin America**: Expanding the program across the region requires overcoming regulatory uncertainties, cultural differences, and varying levels of digital literacy.  


## Future Plans  

- **Leading Web3 Education Across Latin America**: Establishing **Blockchain na Escola** as the leading Web3 education initiative for public institutions across Latin America, preparing students for careers, business opportunities, and talent pipelines in blockchain.  
- **Expanding Teacher Training Programs**: Scaling educator-focused training to equip public school teachers with the tools and knowledge needed to integrate Web3 concepts into their curricula.  
- **Enhancing On-Chain Certification**: Increasing NFT certification adoption by adding tangible benefits and creating a seamless claiming process.  
- **Developing Engaging and Accessible Content**: Expanding educational materials in Portuguese and Spanish with clear, beginner-friendly explanations and interactive learning experiences.  
- **Improving Blockchain Infrastructure in Schools**: Partnering with institutions to overcome technical barriers, ensuring students can interact with blockchain applications despite hardware and connectivity limitations.  
- **Strengthening Talent Pathways**: Creating direct connections between students, Web3 companies, and industry partners to facilitate internships, jobs, and entrepreneurial ventures.  
- **Scaling Across Latin America**: Expanding the program's presence in key regions, addressing cultural and regulatory differences to accelerate Web3 adoption and inclusion.
