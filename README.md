- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We're the @BlockchainnaEscola

## Intro
Blockchain na Escola (Blockchain in School) is an innovative organization dedicated to empowering high school students in public schools with the knowledge and skills to navigate the transformative world of blockchain technology. As a fundamental component of the emerging web3 ecosystem, blockchain presents a paradigm shift in internet infrastructure, unlocking new avenues for economic development and social progress.

## Executive Summary

Blockchain na Escola provided 19 workshops in Salvador, Bahia, and 2 in Rio de Janeiro (through a partnership with Educar+), reaching over 400 students and 20 teachers during the first semester of 2023. For this report, we analyzed survey responses from 80 students.
Those were the first-ever blockchain workshops for public school students in Bahia. 

Our workshop focused on the basic properties of blockchain and use cases of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Examples used during the course focused on social and environmental impact web3 initiatives (you can find the material here). 
The workshops received positive feedback, measured through an NPS of 56 and a workshop satisfaction evaluation of 79 (Top2Box*). 

Studentsâ€™ increasing interest in blockchain-related topics highlighted our significant impact on technology education; data privacy and NFTs were the most interesting topics to surveyed students. 
Going forward, we plan to create a more robust educational program for schools and increase our on-chain footprint by building a dapp to incentivize student learning, facilitate task evaluation for teachers and improve school management for principals.


**A Narrative Shift: From Hope to Hardship**

For the past decade, the narrative surrounding Latin America has transformed from one of vibrancy and hope to one of poverty and authoritarianism. This stark reality has shattered families, businesses, and entire generations, particularly impacting the most vulnerable members of society, robbing them of their dreams.

**Web3 and Blockchain: Tools for Empowerment and Income Generation**

Amidst these challenges, the emergence of web3 and blockchain technology offers a beacon of hope, presenting tools for liberation, empowerment, and income generation within civil society. However, a lack of accessible and jargon-free content in Portuguese and Spanish has created barriers to accessing these transformative tools.

**Blockchain na Escola: Bridging the Gap**

Recognizing this need, Marcelo embarked on a mission to bridge the gap by establishing a blockchain course at a public school in a low-income neighborhood of Serra, EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil. This initiative, aptly named "Blockchain na Escola" (Blockchain in School), proved immensely successful, laying the foundation for an ambitious expansion plan.

**A New Approach: Scaling Web3 Education**

- Building upon the success of the pilot project, Blockchain na Escola identified key pillars for scaling web3 education:

- Connecting with Students: Utilizing the deep bond between teachers and students to foster meaningful engagement.

- Real-World Applications: Integrating web3 concepts with real-world issues related to technology and finance.

- Hands-on Learning: Providing opportunities for practical application through dapp interactions and group activities.

- Continuous Improvement: Embracing feedback and adapting content to align with the evolving needs of students.

**Empowering Public School Teachers**

The next chapter of Blockchain na Escola focuses on training public school teachers to deliver comprehensive web3 education. This approach aims to:

- National Reach: Expand the program's impact across Brazil and potentially throughout Latin America.

- Teacher-Centered Development: Empower teachers to co-create and refine educational content, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness.

- Decentralized Knowledge Sharing: Foster a network of teachers to exchange knowledge and continuously improve teaching practices.

**Web3: A Paradigm Shift for Social and Economic Transformation**

- Blockchain na Escola firmly believes in the transformative power of web3:

- Decentralization: Beyond aesthetics, web3 represents a shift away from the current economic model's monopolistic tendencies.

- User Empowerment: Web3 empowers individuals, challenging the dominance of internet platforms that exploit their users.

- Social and Environmental Impact: Web3 holds immense potential for positive social and environmental impact, particularly in underserved communities.

## Blockchain na Escola Workshop Results

Blockchain na Escola's workshops on blockchain technology reached over 400 students, with positive feedback on enjoyment (79%) and sparking interest (79%). However, there's room for improvement: complexity and lack of relevant content lowered recommendations (NPS: 56). The project plans to address this by creating engaging activities, exploring in-class use of blockchain applications (dapps), and incorporating student interest areas.

Beyond workshops, they delivered presentations at corporate and educational events, reaching a wider audience. They also found that 55% of students displayed a growth mindset, suggesting a higher potential to overcome challenges.

**Challenges Identified:**

* Low NFT certification rate (20%): Likely due to lack of significant benefits tied to the NFTs.
* Limited token distribution (50 out of 100 wallets): Connectivity issues and outdated devices were common barriers.

**Future Plans:**

* Developing a more engaging curriculum with activities.
* Exploring ways to integrate dapps into classroom learning (considering school computer limitations).
* Implementing on-chain tracking to improve learning data collection.
* Offering more valuable benefits for NFT certification.
